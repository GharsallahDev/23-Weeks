### 1. Set Up the Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can name the environment `venv` or any name you prefer.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add the required environment variables. Here is an example of what your `.env` file might look like:

```plaintext
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app.db
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

### 4. Initialize the Database

Set up and migrate the database:

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade
```

### 5. Run the Application

You can now run the Flask application using:

```bash
python run.py
```

The application should start, and you can access it at `http://localhost:5000`.
